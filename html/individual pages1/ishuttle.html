    <div class="text">As college students, the interface of a shuttle app is both familiar and relevant 
        to us. The emotions, however, are often overwhelmingly negative - confusion, frustration, etc. 
        Therefore, we embarked on a journey to redesign the shuttle tracker into one that was clear, 
        engaging, and could transform the entire experience of using a shuttle into a positive one.


        <div class="subtitle">Problem Statement</div>
        To begin, we identified several major pain points that users experienced with the current [3] 
        Harvard shuttle trackers. For clarity, we can divide these points into several categories: 
        <ul class="bullets">
            <li>1) A mismatch between expected shuttle arrival or performance and reality</li>
            <li>2) The inability to determine correct routes given unfamiliarity with the shuttle system</li>
            <li>3) The existence of an outdated, unappealing interface that is both difficult to navigate and 
                which tends to bury features</li>
            <li>4) A miscellaneous category of various features that we felt the shuttle tracker lacked</li></ul>
        <br>
        With regards to the first problem category, we realized that the largest frustration students 
        encountered was that the shuttles were frequently off schedule and, more importantly, that the 
        trackers did not effectively communicate the details of delays/early arrivals accurately, effectively 
        rendering the tracking app useless. It was therefore extremely important for us to maintain an accurate 
        stream of communication system between students and our app.<br>
        <br>
        In terms of the second category, we realized that many students only used the shuttle occasionally, 
        and were therefore unfamiliar with routes and stops. In these scenarios, the current trackers make it 
        difficult to determine which of the routes and stops should be used in a itinerary. Given a 
        student that might only know the starting and ending destinations of his/her journey, we needed our 
        app to be able to easily help them explore the possibilities and determine which route and stops to use.<br> 
        <br>
        The third category is generally concerned with more superficial aspects of the apps; however, the 
        current trackers have such cluttered and unintuitive interfaces that it severely impedes the use of 
        the actual functions. Features are hidden in long lists, users often need to click through too 
        many screens to reach their goal, routes blend together, and it can be difficult if not impossible to 
        determine the direction of the shuttle along the route. <br>
        <br>
        Finally, we also realized that the current tracking apps were missing several important features. 
        The existing apps are not accessible for color-impaired users, which on average is experienced by 1 
        in 12 men and 1 in 200 women. Additionally, certain resources such as campus evening vans are not 
        found in these apps, despite their essential role in maintaining campus safety. <br>
        <br>
        As a point of comparison for the redesigned product, we've included a usage video of Harvard Mobile below:<br><br>

        <div class="subtitle">Users</div>
        After sorting through the problems, it became clear that the shuttle needed to be designed with two 
        different types of users in mind. The first group includes students who use shuttles regularly. 
        These students generally know where they need to go, where they are leaving from, and which shuttle 
        line to take. For this group, then, it is most important to have an app that tracks accurately with an 
        interface that is clear and quick to navigate.<br>
        <br>
        The second group of users is composed of students who use the shuttle infrequently. They are 
        unfamiliar with the shuttle lines, stops, and schedules, and therefore need the app to inform them 
        how to navigate from point A to point B with as little input from them as possible.<br>
        <br>
        We then created a user journey map illustrating what an ideal flow would look like for a shuttle 
        tracker:

        <div class="img-container" style="text-align:center">
            <img src="/iShuttle/UXJourney.jpg" style="width:100%; margin: 5vh 0 0 0">
        </div>

        <div class="subtitle">High Fidelity Prototype</div>
        Finally, we created a high fidelity prototype using Figma.

        <div class="sub-subtitle">Home Page</div>
        To start, we reinvisioned the presentation of routes on the interface. As trackers are largely 
        visual apps, we decided to design the map in grayscale to allow the colored routes to be more 
        easily distinguishable. On the home screen, users can choose to view either all routes simultaneously 
        or only their favorited routes, which accelerates the tracking process for regular shuttle users. 
        Students can further filter routes by selecting one or more routes in the bottom panel. Upon selection, 
        the live shuttles and the stops are shown. Users can then click on a stop to show corresponding details 
        about arrival time. Because it can be frustrating for students to have to continuously check back on 
        shuttle status, we also added a notification button for each stop which, if selected, can notify the 
        student when the shuttle is near (students can edit the time frame for notifications in preferences). 
        <br>
        <div class="container-fluid">
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <img src="/iShuttle/home.gif" style="width:70%; margin:5vh 4vw 5vh 3vw">
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <img src="/iShuttle/crimsoncruiser.gif" style="width:70%; margin:5vh 2vw 5vh 5vw">
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="sub-subtitle">Search and Pin</div>
        As mentioned earlier, the second major group of users is often unfamiliar with the shuttle routes, 
        and therefore needs to be able to discover the correct route and stops easily using the app. To 
        reach this goal, we designed two methods for the user. The first involves the search bar, through 
        which a user can search for a route or stop, in which case the correct match will appear, or they 
        can search for a specific address, in which case a pin will be dropped and nearby stops and routes 
        will be shown. The other method involves finding the physical location of the destination on the map, 
        and then double tapping to manually drop a pin. Similarly to above, the nearby routes and stops will 
        be shown, and the user can then determine which options best fit his/her itinerary. 

        <div class="container-fluid">
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <img src="/iShuttle/search.gif" style="width:70%; margin:5vh 4vw 5vh 3vw">
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <img src="/iShuttle/pin.gif" style="width:70%; margin:5vh 2vw 5vh 5vw">
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="sub-subtitle" style="margin-top:0">Shuttle Calendar</div>
        Another major feature we designed was the inclusion of a personal shuttle schedule. Users can 
        import events that require the use of a shuttle from their personal calendars, in which case a 
        shuttle event will automatically be generated with the best fit shuttle based on time, destination, 
        and starting point. Otherwise, a user can also choose to manually enter a shuttle into their schedule. 
        Once entered, users can choose to receive notifications for these shuttles near arrival time. 
        
        <div class="img-container" style="text-align:center">
            <img src="/iShuttle/cal.gif" style="width:35%; margin:5vh auto">
        </div>

   
        <div class="sub-subtitle" style="margin-top:0">Additional Features</div>
        Finally, our team also included a number of miscellaneous features that we felt could substantially 
        improve the app. The first change made here was to add an accessibility filter for color-impaired 
        users. Textured lines and colors with wider variance are shown in the scenario that the filter is 
        turned on to prevent confusion between close or overlapping lines. The other feature we added was 
        the ability to easily schedule an evening van after a certain time in the evening. Campus evening 
        vans are an important aspect of maintaining both actual and perceived safety, and we therefore felt 
        that it was necessary to make this service much more easily accessible than it is in its current 
        situation, where students must navigate to a separate website, find the number associated with evening 
        vans, and call and schedule in real time for a van. Instead, our feature allows students to request 
        a van directly through the app immediately and in advance to minimize evening waiting time. 

        <div class="container-fluid">
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <img src="/iShuttle/eveningvan.gif" style="width:70%; margin:5vh 4vw 5vh 3vw">
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <img src="/iShuttle/settings.gif" style="width:70%; margin:5vh 2vw 5vh 5vw">
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
    

        <br><div class="subtitle">Conclusion</div>
        Through careful consideration of our users and their needs, we redesigned the existing shuttle 
        tracker into an experience that is both easy and pleasurable to use. iShuttle engages users through 
        its clean, efficient, and accurate interface and provides a number of additional features that 
        transform the tracker into a tool fit for frequent, recurring use.
        <br><br>
        Of course, no product is ever free from the possibility (or perhaps inevitable fate?) of further 
        improvement. We of course have a number of small details to figure out, as well as other additional 
        features we'd like to see included. For one, we think that the communication between the users and
        the app should absolutely be a two way street - in other words, we'd like the students to be able to 
        give immediate and frequent feedback to the shuttle system to allow for constant improvement. We 
        considered having a pop-up notification that would have the user thumbs up or down the shuttle depending
        on its timeliness, but don't want to overburden users with notifications and are unsure about how to 
        determine whether or not the user actually took the shuttle. 
        <br><br>
        It could also potentially be very cool to implement a more detailed feature instructing users on how 
        to get from point A to B and the expected travel times for different routes. 
        <br><br>
        For now, however, having carefully considered our users their goals, we believe that our redesigned 
        shuttle app has the potential to reverse the frustration associated with boarding a shuttle into 
        a swift, painless, and even enjoyable experience. 
        <br><br>
        Thanks for reading!
