                    <h1>about</h1>
                    Wendy Yu is a junior at Harvard College studying History of Art and Architecture.
                    It's as historical and theoretical as it sounds, so in her spare time she likes to 
                    balance out her brain with creative projects - this is recently most often realized
                    through photography, and less often takes place through [occasionally dangerous]
                    furniture building and interior design projects. 
                    <br><br>
                    Recently, she's most excited about having started the Harvard Design Collective 
                    with a group of 5 other amazing women. You can look forward many exciting workshops,
                    panels, challenges, and more related to HDC in the upcoming year.
                    <br><br>
                    She's always looking for new challenges and friends, so please - click on the links
                    in the rightmost column - they're lonely!

                    <h1>what's on my mind?</h1>
                    What would a bike-friendly NYC look like and what would it take?<br><br>
                    There's [some] conversation on increasing diversity of artist 
                    representation in museums, but what about increasing 
                    diversity of visitor footprint in these institutions?<br><br>
