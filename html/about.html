                    <b>about</b><br>
                    Wendy Yu is a junior at Harvard College studying History of Art and Architecture.
                    It's as historical and theoretical as it sounds, so in her spare time she likes to 
                    balance out her brain with creative projects - this is recently most often realized
                    through photography, and less often takes place through [occasionally dangerous]
                    furniture building and interior design projects. 
                    <br><br>
                    Outside of academics, Wendy has done design and marketing work for a number of
                    companies, including ​迪歆品牌 (Shanghai-based design firm), Polo Ralph Lauren, and Harvard's very own Identities. 
                    <br><br>
                    Admittedly, it's not a whole lot of professional experience, but you can look forward
                    to this page filling out a bit as time goes on (or, if you have potential work for her,
                    you can contact her using the rightmost column for reference!).
