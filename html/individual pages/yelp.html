        <div class="title">Yelp Redesign: A Case for <br>Sorting and Simplifying</div>
        <div class="note"><i>Note: This redesign was unsolicited and is unaffiliated with Yelp</i><br><br></div>
    </div>

    <div class="text">After making plans for dinner with friends one day, I turned to Yelp to search for a
        restaurant and found myself suddenly intrigued by the app. I had used the basic search and review functions
        before, but had never looked closely at the countless other buttons and tabs.<br>

        <br>While exploring, I immediately noticed how incredibly repetitive various sections were and how long certain
        pages were. Moreover, several features seemed to have been tacked on to unrelated pages without obvious reasoning, making them
        clutters of miscellaneous categories. Yelp had a host of interesting features, but they were buried in
        long lists, unexposed to and therefore unusable by the average user. I'd always wanted to redesign an app, but had never actually had
        the chance to, so this seemed like a perfect opportunity to learn more about user testing and prototyping while
        extending my understanding of a personally important app.

        <div class="subtitle">User Research & Testing</div>

        The first step I took was to guerilla test with 5 users. The <a href="https://www.yelp.com/factsheet)"><b>Yelp fact sheet</b></a>
        told me that about 35% of users were between 18-34 and another 35% in the 35-54 age range,
        so I tested the app with 3 subjects from the first category and 2 in the second. All had used the website at
        least once, and two had used the app before. I gave them a scenario with a series of tasks as follows:<br>

            <ul class="bullets">
                <li>- Imagine you plan on having dinner with friends in NYC. How would you find a restaurant there?</li>
                <li>- You realize that the list of restaurants is too extensive to browse, and want to filter the suggestions.
                How would you do that?</li>
                <li>- Now that you've found a restaurant, you want to share the business with your friends to see if they
                like it as well before you reserve. How would you do that?</li>
                <li>- When you get there, you are told that you can receive a discount if you check in on Yelp. How would
                you check-in?</li>
                <li>- You have a phenomenal dinner at the restaurant, and would like to thank them by posting a photo and
                leaving a review. How would you do that?</li>
            </ul>

        Afterwards, to guide elimination of function repetition, I asked them a series of questions
        to see where the users would expect to find the feature (more on this later). The questions essentially looked
        like the following:<br>

            <ul class="bullets">
                <li>- In which tab would you expect to find _______ (insert from "Recently viewed," "Reservations," "Bookmarks,"
                and "Collections")? </li>
            </ul>

        Interestingly, Yelp seemed to have updated the app in the middle of my user testing, swapping out the Activity
        tab for a Delivery tab. I found this choice interesting, as a delivery-specific page could already be accessed through
        a relatively prominent icon on the home page. The only difference between this page and the new Delivery
        tab was that the new page contained a free delivery section and an advertisement for GrubHub,
        Seamless, and Eat 24 that took up the majority of the page. Intrigued by this choice to swap out the long-existing Activity tab, I tested out the benefits
        of including a Delivery tab on my last three users with an additional scenario as shown below:<br>

            <ul class="bullets">
                <li>- The weather is terrible outside today, and you don't want to go out to eat but don't want to cook either.
                How would you use Yelp to get food delivered to your home?</li>
            </ul>

        This task provided quite interesting results, but more on that later.<br>

        <div class="subtitle">Results & Synthesis</div>
        User testing gave me extremely useful feedback, which I organized and sorted into several categories.<br>
    </div>

    <div class="img-container" style="background-color:black; text-align:center">
        <img src="/yelp/IMG_7155.jpg" style="width:30%; margin:60px 20px">
    </div>

    <div class="text">
        The greatest issue that I found by far was Yelp's somewhat cluttered information architecture. There was
        repetition without good reason, features had been placed into areas users didn't expect, and certain tabs were
        overloaded with too many functionalities and endless scrolling while other tabs contained little that the users needed.
        For a clearer idea of what I mean, I've mapped out below how the features are currently laid out in the
        app versus how I believed they could be better organized.<br>
    </div>

    <div class="img-container" style="background-color:black; text-align:center">
        <img src="/yelp/yelp-flow1.png" style="width:45%; margin:60px 20px 20px"><img src="/yelp/yelp-flow2.png" style="width:45%; margin:60px 20px 20px">
        <div class="captions">How the information is currently laid out vs. how it could be laid out</div>
    </div>

    <div class="text">
        The various other issues I will go into more detail on when I introduce my solutions using the prototype.<br>

        <br>My testing also allowed me to create two general categories of users on Yelp, one more passive and one more
        active (admittedly, however, most of my testers fell into the passive category). The personas are as follows: <br>
    </div>
        <div class="img-container" style="background-color:black; text-align:center">
            <img src="/yelp/personas1.png" style="width:45%; margin:60px 20px 20px"><img src="/yelp/personas2.png" style="width:45%; margin:60px 20px 20px">
            <div class="captions">Two different personas: Passive vs. Active</div>
        </div>

    <div class="text">
        Creating these profiles allowed me to better accommodate the needs of both types of users and determine which
        solutions would create the best compromise between the app both users wanted.<br>

        <div class="subtitle">Prototype Sketches</div>
        I then sketched out my ideas on a notebook, making note of the important features I wanted to keep and remove
        in each tab.

        <div class="subtitle">High Fidelity Prototype</div>
        Finally, I created a high fidelity prototype using Sketch and Proto.io. I'll go through the prototype
        tab by tab.<br><br><i>Note: In the following images, the "before" screens are shown as a carousel on the left,
        and the redesigned screens are animated in a gif on the right.</i>

        <div class="sub-subtitle">Search Page</div>
        I made only minimal modifications to the home page, as most of it was well organized and self-explanatory. I did, however,
        remove the Featured Collections category as it already existed at the top of the Collections tab and was a little
        overwhelming for the user to consider and look at at once when coupled with the suggested restaurants
        right below and suggested lists right above. <br>

        <br>Searching and filtering is where users ran into more issues. Yelp currently works by providing suggested
        filter buttons which you can easily activate on a bar right above the search results, as well as an icon button
        at the right end of the search bar which brings you to a complete page of filters. While the filter icon is a
        standard icon, it's not immediately and universally recognizable, and its location was a bit hidden. Perhaps
        more importantly, the suggested filter buttons right above the search list are far more noticeable, drawing attention
        away from the smaller filter icon. In fact, only one of the testers found the filter button in less than 20 seconds,
        with the majority of the other users not able to find it at all. Most at first assumed the suggested filters bar
        could expand into a comprehensive list of filters, and when it failed to expand, concluded that those were the
        only filters available for their search. Therefore, I removed the filter icon from the search bar, and instead
        included a filter button on the suggested filter bar with an upwards arrow, making it obvious that tapping on
        the filter bar would allow you to expand the bar upwards for a full list of filters. <br>

        <br>The other adjustment I made to the search function involved the way in which the map view icon works. Currently,
        if you are in list view and you press the map view icon (also at the right end of the search bar), you are brought to map
        view, and then you can click the icon again to bring you back to list view. The catch here, however, is that it
        always brings you back to the beginning of list view. This can be extremely frustrating for users who
        may have already scrolled down significantly on the list, want to check where the restaurants are relative to each other
        or on the map as a whole, and then want to return to their current scroll position without having to manually scroll down
        again. The new map button now brings you back to that previous position.<br>

    <div class="text">
        After finding a restaurant, most of the users had relatively little trouble with the tasks. I did, however,
        get comments on how long the restaurant page was, and had thought the same myself earlier. Therefore, I removed several
        features and consolidated several others.<br>

        <br>The "Photos and Videos" bar, for example, seemed unnecessary as most users simply clicked the photo at
        top to bring them to the full page of photos and videos. The "Share This Business" bar right below it was
        similarly unnecessary, as all testers just used the share icon at the top right corner of the page to share the business.
        I also changed the list of reviews to a horizontal swipe card format, as I found that to be a much more effective
        use of space, and allowed users to see the "Tips" and "Check-in Regulars" categories right below if they found that they were
        more interested in viewing those instead, and didn't want to scroll through a lengthy amount of reviews. Other
        than that, I consolidated important information about the business that viewers might immediately want to be able to
        access (directions, calling, and location on map) at the beginning of the page with the "Leave a Review," "Add a Photo,"
        and "Check-In" sections.<br>

        Moving on, we have the Activity tab, which was changed to Delivery in the middle of my testing. Admittedly, the
        previous Activity tab was not of extreme value to users - it only allowed
        users to see the activity of others, which is important for more active Yelp users but also irrelevant to
        most users who use Yelp solely for their own searches. The Delivery tab, however, did not seem to be much more
        beneficial, as all the testers still clicked on the delivery icon on the home page, with only one user also
        realizing immediately that there was also a Delivery tab on the bottom bar.<br>

        <br>I therefore chose to return the second tab to Activity, but in a way that would hopefully bring significantly
        more utility to the user. I kept the ability to see general activity, but also allowed users to swipe over to view
        their own activity (currently featured in My Activity under Me). I also included Notifications (also from Me) in
        this section, and brought in Recently Viewed (currently in both Me and More) as well, as I considered Recently
        Viewed to be a part of the user's activity. The format is admittedly similar to Instagram's Activity, as
        I find that to be an effective and well-designed solution for such data.<br>

        <div class="sub-subtitle" style="margin-top:0">Me and More Pages</div>
        Next up is the Me section, which I'll couple with More, since the redesign of the two are tied closely
        together (I'll be skipping over Collections, since I didn't actually modify that). Me and More shared the most
        overlap at the beginning - luckily, however, user testing helped me solidify my decisions in where I wanted
        to keep each feature. <br>

        <br>In Me, I first removed the "Notifications" and "Recently Viewed" sections, as I had moved both of those
        to the Activity tab already. I kept "Activity Map" and "Share Your Experience" because I believe having reminders to leave
        reviews is essential to Yelp's business, albeit frustrating to have to scroll through sometimes. I then moved on
        to "My Impact," which currently shows you how many people voted and viewed your reviews and
        photos and, below that, who specifically has voted for and liked your reviews and photos. This second feature,
        however, is essentially the same information as provided in
        "Notifications," so I removed it. Instead, below the numbers of votes and views, I provided a link that allows
        users to see their reviews and photos, which enabled me to remove the "Reviews" and "Photos and Videos" bars from the
        "Explore" section below. From "Explore," I also removed "Bookmarks" and "Collections" (these both literally just bring you
        to the neighboring Collections page), "My Activity" (now in Activity), and "More About Me," which leads you to a more
        detailed profile of yourself. Instead, I put an arrow on the right side of the top profile section, indicating
        that tapping on the profile would bring you to a page with expanded details about the user. On this page, I also
        added an edit button, since profile editing is currently not supported on the app.<br>

        <br>From the More tab, I brought over "Food Orders" and placed it with "Reservations," as I thought
        the two belonged to a similar family of features and users had indicated that they would expect their personal reservations
        and orders to be in Me. Finally, I also brought over "Messages," which, truthfully, before this
        redesign, I had never even realized existed. Messages do not show up in notifications
        and they're buried amidst a number of other features in More, so they're really quite hidden. I instead moved
        the messaging icon to the top right of the Me page, adding a bubble indicator of how many messages users have so
        that it is easier to find and in a more understandable location.<br>

        I also seriously considered removing "Check-Ins" (which can already be found in Activity)
        and moving "Find Friends" to the "Your Friends" page under Me, but according to online resources, check-ins are extremely
        important to businesses, and I thought perhaps an individual feature dedicated to Check-Ins could actually be useful
        for users who might, for example, want to see where their friends are (in a non-stalkerish way of course) and where people
        are going in general. As for "Find Friends," I wasn't sure if it would get buried if users had to go into "Your Friends"
        to find that function - one less click, I supposed, would allow people to find and add friends more easily, which
        is certainly something important to maintaining the community that allows Yelp to thrive.

        <div class="sub-subtitle">Additional Small Changes</div>
        Finally, I made a few small changes to the app and its overall aesthetic. The search bar on the home page
        currently reads "Search for burgers, delivery, barbers on Yelp," to which one of my testers responded by asking if
        she should only search for burgers, delivery, or barbers, which was definitely not what Yelp was aiming for. 
        Therefore, I switched it to a simple
        "What are you looking for?" instead. I also changed user profiles from squares to circles since all business related
        pictures were also squares and having circular profiles allowed for easy differentiation between profiles and pictures.
        As for the overall aesthetic, I removed shadows and lines in various places for a cleaner look and changed several blue
        links to red to promote a unified color scheme.

        <br><div class="subtitle">Conclusion</div>
        Overall, I'm incredibly happy I took on this redesign. It gave me a chance to seriously consider how interface design impacts
        users and their decisions and facilitates their usage of apps. Of course, there is always room for additional
        change and improvement, and certainly there are many other aspects of the Yelp app that would be interesting to
        consider modifying in the future (for example, how to better incentivize users to leave reviews, whether there should be additional categories to sort by,
        etc.). I learned an incredible amount from this experience though, and look forward to doing similar studies
        in the future. Thanks for reading!<br><br><br><br><br>
