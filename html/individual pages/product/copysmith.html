                        <h3>EXPERIMENTATION TEMPLATES</h3><br>
                        We also did a bit of creative experimentation with GPT-3. In this specific instance, we imagined the AI as a means of
                        generating creative brainstorming. Users enter into a conversation with the AI to produce a string of ad campaign ideas.
                        The full flow is as follows:<br><br>

                        And the final screens were modeled off of the prototype here:<br><br>

                    The existing universe of marketing copy is infinitely large, impossible to navigate,
                    and composed of spreadsheet mazes, hours of SEO research, and record-breaking long email chains between writers, managers, and creative directors.
                    <br><br>
                    This is where Copysmith comes in as the figurative Cat in the Hat cleaning machine — without giving away too much, <div class="blue">we entered
                    this sphere with the intention of using AI to eliminate time spent composing marketing copy</div>, although you'll see that much 
                    has changed since then.
                    <br><br>
                    <div style="color:#0017e6; display: inline-block">My role: </div> I joined Copysmith summer of 2020 as their first and initially sole designer (eventually we onboarded another product designer
                    as well as several short term designers from Springboard). At the time, I first joined to design Copysmith's branding, after which I transitioned into the position of Design Lead and spearheaded the development of
                    the MVP and its later iterations. While building the MVP, I also worked closely with our growth and engineering teams.
                    <br><br>
                    <div class="blue">We launched our MVP October 26, 2020 on Product Hunt, and ended as the #2 Product of the Day and are at $23K+ MRR 2 months later. Cheers to

                    <br><br>
                    This case study is focused on MVP development, for which we had 3 primary goals:
                        <ul class="bullets-ee">
                            <li><b>1/</b>  Our tool should first and foremost quickly generate quality copy for users. This meant minimal input on user side.
                            </li>
                            <li><b>2/</b>  We were realistic in our expectations for the quality of AI-generated copy (at least at MVP level); therefore, we 
                                 needed to a) provide users with enough copy to guarantee several good results and b) allow for flexible editing of copy.
                            </li>
                            <li><b>3/</b>  Copy should be stored on an organized, central hub for easy access.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    Below, I'll do a deeper dive into each of these goals and their associated problems.    
                </div>
            </div>

                <h3>PROBLEM DEFINITION</h3>
                This was definitely a non-linear path, and is frankly still evolving. Our team
                <div class="blue">initially envisioned Copysmith as a long-form content generator</div> because we knew that businesses with significant online traffic needed to generate 
                hundreds of blog posts a month, which we imagined to be hugely time consuming. 

                <br><br><br><img src="/img/cs/blog.png" style="width:100%"><br><br><br>

                Specifically, we received feedback along the lines of the following: <br><br>
                <div class="emphasis" style="text-align:center; color:#0017e6">"We currently spend 4-6 hours researching and writing a blog post, and if Copysmith can at least [halve] that, it's a game changer."</div><br>

                To test out our potential in this market, Copysmith had an MVP 0.0 which consisted solely of a Typeform which the user would 
                complete — we would then send their answers to OpenAI's API and return the generated blog post in plain HTML to the user via email.

                <br><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="/img/cs/typeform.png" style="width:70%"></div><br><br>

                As we began speaking to users, however, we quickly ran into 2 realizations:
                    <ul class="bullets-ee">
                        <li><b>1/</b> It is VERY difficult for users to trust AI-generated long-form content off the bat. Post-generation, they
                            will probably still comb through and edit the text quite thoroughly, therefore limiting Copysmith's usefulness.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>2/</b> There is a whole world of short form copy that needs to be generated. This copy is also far more straightforward
                            to generate.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>

                <div class="text">
                    <h3>DESIGN PROCESS </h3>
                    With our revised goal of generating short-form copy, I teamed up with growth to define our target curstomer base
                    and created 2 user personas to better understand the expectations of users. Based off of initial research,<div class="blue">
                        we intended to target a) marketing directors at larger companies and b) owners of SMEs.</div> The personas

                    <ul class="bullets-ee">
                        <li><b>1/</b> Which forms of copy are most valuable to our customers to generate? Internally, we had to work with engineering to
                            determine what types of content could be generated as well as the necessary parameters for each.
                        <li><b>2/</b> What are the minimum and maximum bounds of how much input we can ask from the user, and what is the ideal balance? 
                            <i>(Measured primarily in terms of time, but also in terms of mental energy required by different types of form fields.)</i>
                            This required an understanding of what our users valued more between efficiency and quality.
                        </li>
                    </ul><br>
                    The majority of our questions, however, were difficult to answer without some sort of MVP, so we quickly moved to prototyping and development.

                    <h3>BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD</h3>
                    Having an MVP was crucial for understanding many things about Copysmith's future that remained hidden otherwise.
                    <br><br>
                    Post-launch, our team began organizing feedback immediately. <div class="blue">We sourced user input through several means, including:</div> 
                    <ul class="bullets-ee">
                        <li><b>1/</b> Direct user testing</li>
                        <li><b>2/</b> User Onboarding: we personally onboarded many of our first users both to alleviate the confusion 
                        of using a new interface and to gauge customer understanding.</li>
                        <li><b>3/</b> Hotjar, and later Clarity</li>
                        <li><b>4/</b> Community Slack</li>
                    </ul><br>
                    We received a range of feedback, which I sorted first by <i>micro vs. macro</i> (micro referring to small, independent interface changes - 
                    generally quick to implement and not affecting the core Copysmith product vision, and macro being changes that would significantly
                    affect either the Copysmith audience or product goal and purpose), and then by the below categories:
                    <br><br><br><div style="width:100%; text-align:center"><img src="/img/cs/ad-key.png" style="width:70%;"></div><br><br><br>
                    Within this section, I'll discuss the feedback given for micro changes, and leave macro changes for the "Next Steps" section. 
                    <div class="blue">On the micro end, our user feedback was filtered and assembled into this affinity diagram</div> (click to enlarge):
                    <br><br><br>
                    <!-- <img src="/img/cs/affinity-diagram.png" style="width:100%;"> -->
                    <a class="lightbox" href="#ad" id="ad-small">
                        <img src="/img/cs/affinity-diagram.png" style="width:100%">
                    </a>
                    <br><br><br>
                    The greatest challenge here was prioritizing feedback, especially given limited
                    engineering resources and time.<br><br>
                    
                    Some of the issues were quick to resolve: click to copy became click to edit and drag over text to copy, which allowed us to
                    eliminate the troublesome lock UI. Prioritizing by number of similar feedback and ease of engineering, we also implemented sharing copy, 
                    CSV downloads, and auditing and updating out input fields (more details in the following section).<br><br>

                    Finally, some of the feedback we felt were reasonable changes, but would be longer term endeavors. The biggest needle mover for users, of course, 
                    was always generation quality and variety of copy templates (we had many requests for new copy types ranging from social media captions to
                    Q&A's). <div class="blue">On the design end, we decided our big picture method of making the user
                    journey more efficient and enjoyable had 3 paths:</div> 
                    <ul class="bullets-ee">
                        <li><b>1/</b> Improve organization, both in terms of dashboard architecture and in-file generation organization (folders, presets,
                            tagging and filtering, etc.).</li>
                        <li><b>2/</b> Reduce time to generation (autopopulated fields, word banks/suggestions, presets, bulk importing, etc.).</li>
                        <li><b>3/</b> Flesh out "next steps" post-generation — i.e. "What can I do with this generation, and how do I best get it to my final
                            destination?" (improve sharing, exporting, integrations, etc.) </li>
                    </ul><br>
                    These, however, are longer term changes made as a part of the journey of acheiving product market fit.
                    First, we'll discuss some smaller changes that have already been implemented.

                   It's been incredibly important to sync with other teams consistently both to see if the smaller pieces we're working on align but also to
                   confirm that we agree on the bigger picture of Copysmith at hand.<br><br>
                   We recently teamed up with Iain Thomas, an author and also creative director well versed in the marketing world, to develop our product
                   strategy. <div class="blue">Our latest meeting focused on product market fit and recalibrating our direction, because we realized we had amassed a 
                   considerable user base in the past few weeks that was pulling Copysmith towards different futures.<br><br>
                   Specifically, what Copysmith might look like if we target SMEs v. entrepreneurs v. B2Bs v. agencies v. Shopify stores varies quite 
                   dramatically.</div> Our analytics indicated that product descriptions were our most highly used content template by far, suggesting that 
                   Copysmith could be quite successful as a companion app to Shopify (read: focus on plugins).<br><br>

                   especially if you also have visions for the infinite potential of GPT-3.<br><br>
                   As you might be able to tell, Copysmith is rapidly evolving - we design one thing one day and ship it the next. There are many immediate next 
                   steps already in process, all of which have only been possible thanks to a dream team (shoutout to Jasmine Wang, Emily Chen, Anna Wang,
                   and many more!). Looking forward to contributing to the continued evolution of this product.
