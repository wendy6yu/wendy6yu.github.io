                        We also did a bit of creative experimentation with GPT-3. In this specific instance, we imagined the AI as a means of
                        generating creative brainstorming. Users enter into a conversation with the AI to produce a string of ad campaign ideas.
                        The full flow is as follows:<br><br>

                        And the final screens were modeled off of the prototype here:<br><br>

                    The existing universe of marketing copy is infinitely large, impossible to navigate,
                    and composed of Google Sheet mazes, hours upon hours of SEO research, and chains of emails between writers, managers, and creative directors.
                    <br><br>
                    This is where Copysmith comes in as the figurative Cat in the Hat cleaning machine — without giving away too much, we entered
                    this sphere with the intention of using AI to eliminate time spent composing marketing copy, although you'll see that much 
                    has changed since then.
                    <br><br>
                    I joined Copysmith summer of 2020 as their first and initially sole designer (eventually we onboarded another product designer
                    as well as several short term designers from Springboard). At the time, I first joined to design Copysmith's branding and general
                    design system, after which I transitioned into the position of lead product designer and spearheaded the development of
                    MVP and its later iterations. While building the MVP, I also worked closely with our growth and engineering teams.
                    <br><br>
                    We launched our MVP October 26, 2020 on Product Hunt, and ended as the #2 Product of the Day and have since amassed over 1200 upvotes.
                    <br><br>
                    This case study is focused on MVP development, for which we had 3 primary goals:
                        <ul class="bullets-ee">
                            <li><b>1/</b>  Our tool should first and foremost quickly generate quality copy for users. This meant minimal input on user side.
                            </li>
                            <li><b>2/</b>  Some degree of flexibility should be embedded in the interface — we decided users would strongly desire the 
                                ability to sort through and refine copy.
                            </li>
                            <li><b>3/</b>  Copy should be stored on an organized, central hub for easy access.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    Below, I'll do a deeper dive into each of these goals and their associated problems.    
                </div>
            </div>

                <h3>PROBLEM DEFINITION</h3>
                This was definitely a non-linear path, and is frankly still evolving. If we backtrack to the very beginning, our team
                initially envisioned Copysmith as a long-form content generator because we knew that businesses with significant online traffic needed to generate 
                hundreds of blog posts a month, which we imagined to be hugely time consuming. 

                <br><br><img src="/img/cs/blog.png" style="width:100%"><br><br>

                To test out this idea, Copysmith had a pre-MVP product which consisted solely of a somewhat lengthy Typeform which the user would 
                complete — we would then feed their answers into the AI and have it return a blog post, which we would email in plain HTML to the user.
                As we began speaking to users, however, we quickly ran into 2 realizations:
                    <ul class="bullets-ee">
                        <li><b>1/</b> It is VERY difficult for users to trust AI-generated long-form content. Post-generation, they
                            will probably still comb through and edit the text quite thoroughly, therefore limiting Copysmith's usefulness.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>2/</b> There is a whole world of short form copy that needs to be generated. This copy is also far more straightforward
                            for our AI to generate.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>DESIGN PROCESS </h3>
                    With our revised goal of generating short-form copy, we teamed up with growth to define our target curstomer base
                    and created 2 user personas to better understand the expectations of users. We ended with the following user types:<br><Br>

                    After speaking to a range of potential users, we were able to confirm that,
                    at minimum, our MVP needed 2 parts: 1) a dashboard to store and organize files, and 2) files which stored and generated copy. 
                    The planned user flow looked as follows:
                    
                    <br><br><img src="/img/cs/mvp-flow.png" style="width:100%"><br><br>
                    
                    Some other important questions we asked potential users included: 
                    <ul class="bullets-ee">
                        <li><b>1/</b> Which forms of copy are most valuable to our customers to generate? Internally, we the had to work with engineering to
                            determine what the necessary parameters were for each.
                        <li><b>2/</b> What are the minimum and maximum bounds of how much input we can ask from the user, and what is the ideal balance?
                            This required an understanding of what our users valued more between efficiency and quality.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    The majority of our questions, however, were difficult to answer without some sort of MVP, so we quickly moved to prototyping and development.

                    <h3>MVP - HIGH FIDELITY PROTOTYPE</h3>
                    Omitting the intermediary drafts and trial, our completed MVP was a simple set of screens driven by the <i>singular goal
                    of generating original, quality short form content with minimal work for the user</i>.<br><br>
                    Creating copy only took 3 steps:<br><br>

                    </div>
                    We also provided users with a number of ways to interact with their copy post-generation as follows:<br><br>
                    <div class="container-fluid" style="margin:0; padding:1vh; font-size: 2vh; line-height:3vh;">

                    <h3>BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD</h3>
                    Having an MVP was crucial for understanding many things about Copysmith's future that remained hidden otherwise.
                    <br><br>
                    Post-launch, our team began organizing feedback immediately. We sourced user input through several means, including: 
                    <ul class="bullets-ee">
                        <li><b>1/</b> Direct user testing</li>
                        <li><b>2/</b> User Onboarding: we personally onboarded many of our first users both to alleviate the confusion 
                        of using a new interface and to gauge customer understanding.</li>
                        <li><b>3/</b> Hotjar</li>
                        <li><b>4/</b> Community Slack</li>
                    </ul>
                    We received a range of feedback, which I sorted first by <i>micro vs. macro</i> (micro referring to small, independent interface changes - 
                    generally quick to implement and not affecting the core Copysmith product vision, and macro being changes that would significantly
                    affect either the Copysmith audience or product goal and purpose), and then by the below categories:
                    <br><br><div style="width:100%; text-align:center"><img src="/img/cs/post-it-key.png" style="width:70%;"></div><br><br>
                    Within this section, I'll discuss the feedback given for micro changes, and leave macro changes for the "Next Steps" section. 
                    On the micro end, our user feedback was filtered and assembled into this affinity diagram:
                    <br><br><img src="/img/cs/micro.png" style="width:100%;"><br><br>
                    More difficult than sourcing feedback was sorting through the feedback and prioritizing changes, especially given limited
                    engineering resources and time.<br><br>
                    Some of the issues were quick to resolve: click to copy became click to edit and drag over text to copy, which allowed us to
                    eliminate the troublesome lock UI. We received many requests for a CSV download, so we also implemented that function. Based off
                    of the quantity of similar feedback, we also deemed some sort of share ability and certain changes to our input form necessary and 
                    relatively easy to implement — these I'll detail in the following section.<br><br>
                    Finally, some of the feedback we felt were reasonable changes, but would be longer term endeavors — in particular, we decided we needed to improve
                    our dashboard architecture and in-file generation organization, but are still in the process of designing and
                    implementing these changes.

                             tooltips next to fields that users found confusing to fill out.

                    <h3>NEXT STEPS</h3>
                   It's been incredibly important to sync with other teams consistently both to see if the smaller pieces we're working on align but also to
                   confirm that we agree on the bigger picture of Copysmith at hand.<br><br>
                   We recently teamed up with Iain Thomas, an author and also creative director well versed in the marketing world, to develop our product
                   strategy. Our latest meeting focused on product market fit and recalibrating our direction, because we realized we had amassed a 
                   considerable user base in the past few weeks that was pulling Copysmith towards different futures.<br><br>
                   Specifically, what Copysmith might look like if we target SMEs v. entrepreneurs v. B2Bs v. agencies v. Shopify stores varies quite 
                   dramatically. Our analytics indicated that product descriptions were our most highly used content template by far, suggesting that 
                   Copysmith could be quite successful as a companion app to Shopify (read: focus on integrations).<br><br>
                   More details regarding this section are confidential, but if you'd like to discuss this, please reach out to me! I would love to talk,
                   especially if you also have visions for the infinite potential of GPT-3.<br><br>
                   As you might be able to tell, Copysmith is rapidly evolving - we design one thing one day and ship it the next. There are many immediate next 
                   steps already in process, all of which have only been possible thanks to a dream team (shoutout to Jasmine Wang, Emily Chen, Anna Wang,
                   and many more!). Looking forward to contributing to the continued evolution of this product.
