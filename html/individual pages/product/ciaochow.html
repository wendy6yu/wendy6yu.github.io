                <div class="text">
                    Last semester in EngSci-22: Designing for Desirability, we were assigned a 1-week-long design 
                    challenge in which we were asked to a) conceptualize a product that targeted and modified a specific behavior 
                    using Cialdini’s and/or Fogg’s theories on human behavior and b) to create a user experience 
                    journey map as our deliverable.
                    <br><br>
                    My group envisioned an app that <div class="blue">targeted decision fatigue associated with finding and picking 
                    restaurants</div> by gamifying the experience through a Tinder-esque swipe UI that was easily filterable and 
                    reduced the often text-heavy interfaces of restaurant apps to a majority visual interface.
                    <br><br>
                    While my group decided to focus on a visual experience targeted towards the individual, as I was at office hours working through 
                    product details with my TF (big, big, shoutout to Rosa Weinberg for her time and advice), we came up 
                    with a branching idea that was so much fun that I needed to write it down as a formal proposal. 
                    That said, here it is below!
                </div>

                <h3>THE CHALLENGE</h3>
                My target behavioral problem was more specifically as follows: <div class="blue">the indecision in deciding where to eat that occurs 
                in group settings.</div>

                <br><br><img src="/img/easyeats/screenshot-cc.png" style="width:100%"><br><br>
                <!-- <div class="dropdown">

                    <div class="content"> <p>-->
                        In order to help groups make eating decisions more efficiently, I first needed to understand why this  
                        indecision occured. <div class="blue">So why is choosing a restaurant so difficult for groups?</div> I boiled it down to three 
                        major categories:
                        <ul class="bullets-ee">
                            <li><b>1/</b>  Taking responsibility for your own happiness (food = happiness) is one thing, but being responsible for others’ 
                                happiness is an entirely separate problem. It doesn't help that food is a highly personal preference that can vary from day
                                to day or even hour to hour.
                                <!-- <div class="sub-bullets">
                                    - Food is a highly personal preference and, to make it even more complicated, it can vary 
                                    day to day or even hour to hour for any given individual. It’s extremely difficult to 
                                    predict or understand someone else’s preferences, so why would you want to risk choosing
                                    a meal that another person dislikes?
                                    <br><br>- Also, inside you know that you have your personal preferences, but you don’t 
                                    want to be the person that imposes your preferences on others and then becomes responsible
                                    for the entire group's happiness. 
                                </div> -->
                            </li>
                            <li><b>2/</b>  There are So. Many. Choices. This indecision-increasing factor applies to both individuals and groups. 
                                There are countless options for food, and while we would generally agree that optionality a 
                                privilege, humans don’t always seem to do too well with it. 
                            </li>
                            <li><b>3/</b>  Am I going to spend my time and energy Yelping, or are you? Yelp is wonderful and I use it 
                                all the time, but it is also a dense and energy-draining website. Everyone is tired, and everyone wants to delegate the research to someone else.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                            <!-- </p>

                </div> -->
                </div>
            </div>

            <hr>
            <div id="three" class="image">
                <div class="text">
                    <h3>SOLUTION</h3>
                    To resolve this indecision, Ciao Chow! aims to do the following:
                    <ul class="bullets-ee">
                        <li><b>1/</b>  It <div class="blue">incorporates all members in the decision-making process</div>, and therefore divides up the 
                            responsibility between the group so that the pressure is reduced for every individual.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>2/</b>  It gives the group a <div class="blue">limited number of choices</div>, because in the end having 10,000 options 
                            on Yelp v. having 20 options on this app is not really going to affect anyone's meal utility [in terms 
                            of satisfaction gained]. As the age-old adage goes, “You can’t miss what you 
                            never had."
                        </li>
                        <li><b>3/</b>  It makes the entire process less energy-draining by employing a <div class="blue">gamified, visual interface 
                            that encourages users to make quick choices based on visceral reactions</div>. As the other age-old 
                            adage goes, “A picture is worth 1000 words.”
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    So how does this app achieve the goals above? I maintained the swipe interface that my team 
                    used for our restaurant app in the design challenge, but modified it so that all members of a dinner 
                    party can enter into a group.<br><br>
                    The app then presents a set of filters, which breaks down the decision making process  
                    through straightforward questions that are easy to answer. <br><br>
                    Afterwards, each member is individually shown a set of restaurant cards on their app, which 
                    they swipe through on their own time (it should only take a few minutes maximum for an individual). When 
                    all members of the group finish swiping, the group is shown the cards that all members have swiped right on 
                    or “liked.” In this manner, the app cuts the number of restaurant options down significantly
                    and guarantees that the final selection is one that maximizes that satisfaction of all group 
                    members. 
                    <br><br>
                    For a better idea of the breakdown of the process, I’ve attached a user journey map below (click to enlarge).

                    <h3>HIGH FIDELITY PROTOTYPE</h3>
                    Below, I've walked through the final app in more detail.<br><br>
                    <div class="container-fluid" style="margin:0; padding: 0">
                        <div class="row">

                             1/ The core of the app revolves around restaurant "cards," which package essential information regarding the restaurant
                             in a largely visual and digestable manner. Users can make a reservation directly through each card, or simply swipe 
                             right to save it.
                            </div>
                            <div class="col-md-5" style="text-align: center;">

                        <div class="row" style="margin-top: 8vh;">
                            <div class="col-md-7" style="padding-right: 5vw;">
                             2/ Any individual can start a group and set constraints or filters for the group cards (these can be modified by group 
                             members later). All group members are then asked to swipe on the same set of cards by a certain time, after which the 
                             app presents only the most-liked cards to the group to select from.

                            </div>
                            <div class="col-md-5" style="text-align: center;">

                    <br><br>
                    This app works for individual use as well. Users can swipe on their own time (with the help of filters for more efficent swiping) or 
                    select from their previously "liked" restaurants.<br><br>

                    <h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
                    Decision fatigue plagues both individuals and groups, but can be resolved or at least minimized by
                    the effective use of technology and the provision of certain givens or constraints.<br><br>
                    While this app is designed to reduce the mental strain of nagivating the complex world of group decisions,
                    there are a number of further considerations to work through, such as:
                    <ul class="bullets-ee">
                        <li><b>1/</b>  At what point does creating and 
                            swiping through these groups actually become more work than choosing a restaurant?
                        </li>
                        <li><b>2/</b>  What are the bounds of too much and too little information (pictures included) to show on each restaurant card?
                        </li>
                        <li><b>3/</b>  Do we allow restaurants to pick and choose
                            their photos (which might allow in inaccuracy), or do we allow users to upload and choose the photos (which might result
                            in too many photos - who would sort through and select then)?
                        </li>
