                    PlayHouse is an early-stage startup currently housed at the Harvard Innovation Labs. The PlayHouse app focuses on bringing a 
                    3rd dimension of entertainment and interaction to what has now become 2D virtual performance.
                    <br><br>

                    5 wonderful women and myself) took on PlayHouse as one of our clients. I served as design lead for this project, and worked closely
                    with several of our agency's designers to define the scope of their product, design the architecture of their app, and prototype a few of 
                    the screens.  
                    <br><br>
                    Our project cycle finished in November, and PlayHouse is currently in development stage.
                    <br><br>
                    This case study is focused on PlayHouse's general product ideation and on the design of the dashboard section of MVP.

                <h3>PROBLEM DEFINITION</h3>
                The PlayHouse initiative began as a web app intended to stream performances and provide interactive programs that would bring a 
                missing sense of fun to virtual theater. Our clients quickly ran into a number of legal and partnership issues regarding streaming,
                however, so it became necessary to pivot the central purpose of their product.

                <br><br><!--<img src="/img/cs/blog.png" style="width:100%"><br><br> -->

                <div class="blue">Rather than replacing existing streaming services, our team focused on designing PlayHouse as a companion app.</div> 
                
                <br><br>  
                Our clients had already
                defined their audience to be frequent performance (especially theater) attendees, and had conducted early interviews around the idea of 
                Playhouse. After speaking closely with the founders and understanding their vision for the app and pain points they had noted from these
                interviews,  <div class="blue">we realized that they had two problems in focus:</div>
                    <ul class="bullets-ee">
                        <li><b>1/</b> Users found it frustrating to need to navigate from website to website to discover shows, acquire
                            information, and book tickets from each different venue.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>2/</b> Post-transition to streamed performances due to Covid, many theater enthusiasts were disappointed with the virtual
                            experience and missed the feeling and excitement of going to a physical venue.
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>

            <hr>
            <div id="three" class="image">
                <div class="text">
                    <h3>DESIGN PROCESS </h3>
                   With respect to the two problems we defined above, my team proposed the below solution to each:
                    <ul class="bullets-ee">
                        <li><b>1/</b> Allow users to curate their own playhouse — a collection of concert and theater venues for easy, centralized
                            access to information from different places.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>2/</b> Design fun, interactive programs that users can browse as they livestream shows, allowing a more in depth understanding
                            of and connection with the show than a plain text PDF might achieve. 
                    </ul>

                    <br> 
                    <i>Our thoughts: There has to be something better than this!</i><br><br>  
                    <div class="container-fluid" style="margin:0; padding: 0">
                        <div class="row">
                            <div class="col-md-4">
                                <img src="/img/playhouse/programpdf.png" style="width:85%;">
                            </div>
                            <div class="col-md-8" style="text-align: center;">
                                <img src="/img/playhouse/theater-sites.png" style="width:90%;">
                            </div>
                        </div>
                    </div><br>
                    
                    <br>The interactive program could be tackled as a relatively independent component, so we temporarily set that aside and focused on
                   how we would aggregate and organize venue information while maintaining PlayHouse's fun and experimental core branding. <div class="blue">We 
                    divided the app into 3 levels of curation:</div>
                    <ul class="bullets-ee">
                        <li><b>1/</b> A "Saved" tab: This would be the most user-curated tab — individual shows handpicked by the user, falling into the 
                            categories of either "Saved for the future" or "Purchased ticket to."
                        </li>
                        <li><b>2/</b> An "Explore" tab: This would be the least user-curated tab — shows and venues suggested by the app, albeit based
                            loosely off of past user behavior.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>3/</b> The user's dashboard, or "Playhouse": This was intended to fall between the previous 2 in terms of user-curation. 
                            Venues would be added personally by the user; however, the performances shown in each venue would be ones selected by 
                            the venue themselves (through a separate internal interface).
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    This can best be seen through our proposed diagram of the app's architecture (click to enlarge):
                    <br><br>
                    <a class="lightbox" href="#flow" id="flow-small">
                        <img src="/img/playhouse/flow.png" style="width:100%">
                    </a> 
                    <br><br> <br>
                    
                    We then proceeded to develop the screens outlined in red, starting with many very rough idea sketches.
                   <br><br><div style="text-align:center"><img src="/img/playhouse/rough-sketch.JPG" style="width:100%"></div><br><br>

                    And eventually refining them in Figma after some discussion amongst our team and with the clients and their engineering team.
                    <br><br><div style="text-align:center"><img src="/img/playhouse/sketch.png" style="width:100%"></div><br><br>

                    We used these slightly more refined screens to source user feedback from HDC's agency members, which we then incorporated into
                    the high-fidelity prototype below.

                </div>

                    <h3>HIGH FIDELITY PROTOTYPE</h3>
                    All primary information and activity is connected to the user's dashboard in the PlayHouse app. This was designed as a digital
                    literal play "house," or a building designed by the user to house all preferred venues. While we brainstormed a number of different 
                    methods of representing distinct venues and spaces, our team ended up moving forward with the idea of a floorplan, which already
                    carries a familiar association with space and buildings in particular. 
                    <br><br>
                    Users can interact with their dashboard in 3 different ways:<br><br>
                    <div class="container-fluid" style="margin:0; padding: 0">
                        <div class="row">
                            <div class="col-md-8">
                             1/ Users can <div class="blue">browse their existing playhouse for venue updates </div> (primarily to check if new shows have been added, represented
                             by a gem icon). Each venue block, when tapped, brings up a page with venue information, updated internally by the venues
                             themselves.
                            </div>
                            <div class="col-md-4" style="text-align: center;">
                                <img src="/img/playhouse/dashboard2.png" style="width:100%;">
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <div class="row" style="margin-top: 5vh;">
                            <div class="col-md-8">
                             2/ Users can edit their playhouse — <div class="blue">floors and blocks can be deleted, moved, or updated</div> in both
                             floorplan view and list view.

                            </div>
                            <div class="col-md-4" style="text-align: center;">

                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <div class="row" style="margin-top: 5vh;">
                            <div class="col-md-8">
                             3/ From editing mode, users can also<div class="blue"> add either a venue or floor</div>. A rectangular block representing a venue
                             can be customized and added to any floor, or a floor (a grouping of venues) can be added to the entire PlayHouse.
                            </div>
                            <div class="col-md-4" style="text-align: center;">
                                <img src="/img/playhouse/add-block.gif" style="width:100%; border: 1px solid black;">
                            </div>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <br><br>
                    An additional feature we had discussed with the client was the possibility of rendering the playhouse in 3D upon horizontal
                    phone orientation.<br><br>  
                    <img src="/img/playhouse/X - 1.png" style="width:105%;">
                    
                    <br><br>
                    However, while this was and remains an exciting creative idea, we removed this feature for several reasons, including:
                    <ul class="bullets-ee">
                        <li><b>1/</b> What did the 3D interface bring to the table that the 2D interface didn't already have? We imagined the 3D
                            interface to be a fun, gamified experience — for example, users might treasure hunt for new shows or other hidden features,
                            but found that we couldn't otherwise justify the additional user confusion this would cause.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>2/</b> Practically speaking, this would require engineering expertise that simply was not available at the time.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    Finally, we also prototyped a live chat screen and an interactive program for PlayHouse in Figma.
                    <br><br>
                    Select stills from our high-fidelity prototype:<br><br>

                    <h3>REFLECTION</h3>
                    In general, this app dealt with a topic very close to my interests — that concerning the increasing transition of physical spaces
                    and interactions to digital forms and means. We were constantly asking ourselves questions such as, "What do the users miss most 
                    about actually going to venues? What are existing problems of physical venues? What are familiar indicators and symbols found in 
                    venues that audience members might find either useful or comforting? What are other physical things or spaces that have 
                    transitioned well to digital?" etc. 
                    <br><br>
                    That being said, because I am so interested in this at an academic level, it was easy to get carried away and often necessary
                    to reel myself back in for a reality check on how practical and usable the app was. 
                    <br><br>
                    Finally, this was a project with a relatively condensed timeline and a very widely spread team (we had a team member across the ocean in 
                    Singapore!). All members of the design team were also simultaneously occupied full-time either as a student or intern, meaning 
                    efficient and consistent communication ended up being extremely vital to project success. Despite the unprecedented circumstances, 
                    however, I am insanely grateful to have worked with a machine of a team — will definitely miss our rose-bud-thorn check-ins
                    at each meeting and Figma cursor-hovering! <br><br>

                    This is where our product is currently at, although certainly not where it will stay at for long. Improved since MVP 1 are
                    the following: <br><br>

                             1/ We updated the audience and brand keywords UI to resolve the limiting column format. We also added explanatory
                             tooltips next to fields that users found confusing to fill out.

                             2/ We designed an onboarding process, during which users would be able to fill out essential info used later to
                             autopopulate templates.

                            3/ We shipped a share function, which produced a URL with the generated copy in list format. We also added an upvote/downvote 
                            system to this page to maximize team collaboration.
