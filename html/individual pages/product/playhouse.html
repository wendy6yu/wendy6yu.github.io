                    PlayHouse is an early-stage startup currently housed at the Harvard Innovation Labs. The PlayHouse app focuses on bringing a 
                    3rd dimension of entertainment and interaction to what has now become 2D virtual performance.
                    <br><br>
                    My role: This fall, the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/harvarddesignco/" target="blank" style="font-size: 3vh; color:#0017e6">Harvard Design Collective</a> (Harvard's first organization for digital creatives, founded by
                    5 wonderful women and myself) took on PlayHouse as one of our clients. I served as design lead for this project, and worked closely
                    several of our agency designers to define the scope of their product, design the architecture of their app, and prototype a few of 
                    the screens.  
                    <br><br>
                    Our project cycle just finished, and PlayHouse is now in app development stage.
                    <br><br>
                    This case study is focused on PlayHouse's general product ideation and on the design of the dashboard section of MVP.

                <h3>PROBLEM DEFINITION</h3>
                The PlayHouse initiative began as a web app intended to stream performances and provide interactive programs that might bring a 
                missing sense of fun to virtual theater. Our clients quickly ran into a number of legal and partnership issues regarding streaming,
                however, so it became necessary to pivot the central purpose of their product.

                <br><br><!--<img src="/img/cs/blog.png" style="width:100%"><br><br> -->

                Rather than replacing existing streaming services, our team focused on designing PlayHouse as a companion app. Our clients had already
                defined their audience to be frequent performance (especially theater) attendees, and had conducted early interviews around the idea of 
                Playhouse. After speaking closely with the founders and understanding their vision for the app and pain points they had noted from these
                interviews, we realized that they had two problems in focus:
                    <ul class="bullets-ee">
                        <li><b>1/</b> Users found it frustrating to need to navigate from venue website to venue website to discover shows, acquire
                            information, and book tickets from each.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>2/</b> Post-transition to streamed performances due to Covid, many theater enthusiasts were disappointed with the virtual
                            experience and missed the feeling and excitement of going to a physical venue.

                <div class="text">
                    <h3>DESIGN PROCESS </h3>
                   With respect to the two problems we defined above, my team proposed the below solution to each:
                    <ul class="bullets-ee">
                        <li><b>1/</b> Allow users to curate their own playhouse — a collection of concert and theater venues for easy, centralized
                            access to information from different places.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>2/</b> Design fun, interactive programs that users can browse as they livestream shows, allowing more in depth understanding
                            of and connection with the show than a plain text PDF might achieve. 
                    </ul>
                    
                    <br>The interactive program could be tackled as a relatively independent component, so we temporarily set that aside and focused on
                    the ability to aggregate and organize venue information while maintaining PlayHouse's fun and experimental core branding. We 
                    divided the app into 3 levels of curation:
                    <ul class="bullets-ee">
                        <li><b>1/</b> A "Saved" tab: This would be the most curated tab — individual shows handpicked by the user, falling into the 
                            categories of either "Saved for the future" or "Purchased ticket to."
                        </li>
                        <li><b>2/</b> An "Explore" tab: This would be the least curated tab — shows and venues suggested by the app, albeit based
                            loosely off of past user behavior.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>3/</b> The user's dashboard, or "Playhouse": This was intended to fall between the previous 2 in terms of curation. 
                            Venues would be added personally by the user, however, the performances shown in each venue selected by the venue themselves 
                            (through a separate internal interface).
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    This can best be seen through our proposed diagram of the app's architecture:
                    <br><br><img src="/img/playhouse/flow.png" style="width:100%"><br><br>
                    
                    We then proceeded to build the screens outlined in red in Figma.

                    <h3>REFLECTION</h3>
                    In general, this app dealt with a topic very close to my interests — that concerning the increasing transition of physical spaces
                    and interactions to digital forms and means. We were constantly asking ourselves questions such as, "What do the users miss most 
                    about actually going to venues? What are existing problems of physical venues? What are familiar indicators and symbols found in 
                    venues that audience members might find either useful or comforting? What are other physical things or spaces that have 
                    transitioned well to digital?" etc. 
                    <br><br>
                    This being said, because I am so interested in this on an academic level, it was easy to get carried away and often necessary
                    to reel myself back in for a reality check on how practical and usable the app was. 
                    <br><br>
                    Finally, this was a project with a relatively condensed timeline and a very widely spread team (we had a team member across the ocean in 
                    Singapore!). All members of the design team were also simultaneously occupied full-time either as a student or intern, meaning 
                    efficient and consistent communication ended up being extremely vital to project success. Despite the unprecedented circumstances, 
                    however, I am insanely grateful to have worked with a machine of a team — will definitely miss our rose-bud-thorn check-ins
                    at each meeting and Figma cursor-hovering! <br><br>
