                <div class="col-md-8 right">
                    To begin, we identified several major pain points that users experienced with the current [3] 
                    Harvard shuttle trackers. For clarity, we can divide these points into several categories: 
                    <ul class="bullets">
                        <li><b>1/</b>  A mismatch between expected shuttle arrival or performance and reality</li>
                        <li><b>2/</b>  The inability to determine correct routes given unfamiliarity with the shuttle system</li>
                        <li><b>3/</b>  The existence of an outdated, unappealing interface that is both difficult to navigate and 
                            which tends to bury features</li>
                        <li><b>4/</b>  A miscellaneous category of various features that we felt the shuttle tracker lacked</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="text">
                <div class="dropdown">
                    <button type="button" class="collapsible dropdown-toggle">Read more on user pain points</button>
                    <div class="content">
                        <p>With regards to the first problem category, we realized that the largest frustration students 
                            encountered was that the shuttles were frequently off schedule and, more importantly, that the 
                            trackers did not effectively communicate the details of delays/early arrivals, effectively 
                            rendering the tracking app useless. It was therefore extremely important for us to maintain an accurate 
                            stream of communication system between students and our app.<br>
                            <br>
                            In terms of the second category, we realized that many students only used the shuttle occasionally 
                            and were therefore unfamiliar with routes and stops. In these scenarios, the existing trackers make it 
                            difficult to determine which of the routes and stops should be used in an itinerary. Given a 
                            student that might only know the start and end destinations of their journey, we needed our 
                            app to be able to easily help them explore the possibilities and determine which route and stops to use.<br> 
                            <br>
                            The third category is generally concerned with more superficial aspects of the apps; however, the 
                            current trackers have such cluttered and unintuitive interfaces that it severely impedes the use of 
                            the actual functions (features are hidden in long lists, users often need to click through too 
                            many screens to reach their goal, routes blend together, etc.). <br>
                            <br>
                            Finally, we also realized that the current tracking apps were missing several important features. 
                            The existing apps are not accessible for color-impaired users, which on average is experienced by 1 
                            in 12 men and 1 in 200 women. Additionally, certain resources such as campus evening vans require
                            inconvenient navigation to a separate app, despite their essential role in maintaining campus safety. <br>

                <br>As a point of comparison for the redesigned product, we've included a usage video of Harvard Mobile below:<br><br>

                <div class="col-md-8 right">
                    After sorting through the problems, it became clear that the shuttle needed to be designed with two 
                    different types of users in mind. The first group includes students who use shuttles regularly. 
                    These students generally know where they need to go, where they are leaving from, and which shuttle 
                    line to take. For this group, then, it is most important to have an app that tracks accurately with an 
                    interface that is clear and efficient to navigate.<br>
                    <br>
                    The second group of users is composed of students who use the shuttle infrequently. They are 
                    unfamiliar with the shuttle lines, stops, and schedules, and therefore need the app to inform them 
                    how to navigate from point A to point B with as little input from them as possible.<br>

            <div class="text" style="text-align: left;">
                Post user-research, we created a user journey map illustrating what an ideal flow would look like for a shuttle 
                tracker:

                <div class="col-md-8 right">
                    Finally, we created a high fidelity prototype using Figma. The major features are described in detail below.

                        As trackers are largely 
                    visual apps, we decided to design the map in grayscale to allow the colored routes to be more 
                    easily distinguishable. On the home screen, users can choose to view either all routes simultaneously 
                    or only their favorited routes, which accelerates the tracking process for regular shuttle users. 
                    Students can further filter routes by selecting one or more routes in the bottom panel.

                    Upon selection,

                    about arrival time. Because it can be frustrating for students to have to continuously check back on 
                    shuttle status, we also added a notification button for each stop which, if selected, can notify the 
                    student when the shuttle is near (students can edit the time frame for notifications in preferences).

                <div class="col-md-8 right">
                    The second major group of users is often unfamiliar with the shuttle routes, 
                    and therefore needs to be able to discover the correct route and stops easily using the app. To 
                    reach this goal, we designed two methods for the user.

                <div class="col-md-5 left description">
                    The first involves the search bar, through 
                    which a user can search for a route or stop, in which case the correct match will appear, or they 
                    can search for a specific address, in which case a pin will be dropped and nearby stops and routes 
                    will be shown.

                <div class="col-md-5 right description">
                    The second method involves finding the physical location of the destination on the map, 
                and then double tapping to manually drop a pin. Similarly to above, the nearby routes and stops will 
                be shown, and the user can then determine which options best fit his/her itinerary.

                    Another major feature we designed was the inclusion of a personal shuttle schedule. Users can

                    shuttle event will automatically be generated with the best fit shuttle based on time, destination, 
                    and starting point. Otherwise, a user can also choose to manually enter a shuttle into their schedule. 
                    Once entered, users can choose to receive notifications for these shuttles near arrival time.

                    Finally, our team also included a number of miscellaneous features that we felt could substantially

                    turned on to prevent confusion between close or overlapping lines.

                    The other feature we added was 
                    the ability to easily schedule an evening van after a given time in the PM. Campus evening 
                    vans are essential to maintaining both actual and perceived safety, and we therefore felt 
                    that it was necessary to make this service much more accessible than it is currently, 
                    where students must navigate to a separate website, find the number associated with evening 
                    vans, and call and schedule in real time for a van. Instead, our feature allows students to request 
                    a van directly through the app immediately and in advance to minimize waiting time.

            <div class="subtitle" style="padding-bottom: 3vh">CONCLUSION</div>
            Through careful consideration of our users and their needs, we redesigned the existing shuttle 
            tracker into an experience that is both easy and pleasurable to use. iShuttle engages users through 
            its clean, efficient, and accurate interface and provides a number of additional features that 
            transform the tracker into a tool fit for frequent, recurring use.
            <br><br>
            Of course, no product is ever free from the possibility (or perhaps inevitable fate?) of further 
            improvement. We have a number of small details to figure out, as well as other additional 
            features we'd like to see included. For one, we think that the communication between the users and
            the app should absolutely be a two way street - in other words, we'd like the students to be able to 
            give immediate and frequent feedback to the shuttle system to allow for constant improvement. We 
            considered having a pop-up notification that would have the user thumbs up or down the shuttle depending
            on its timeliness, but are still navigating the balance between enough notifications to be helpful
            and too many notifications which can become burdensome.
            <br><br>
            Additionally, it could potentially be very cool to implement a more detailed feature instructing users on how 
            to get from point A to B and the expected travel times for different routes. 
            <br><br>
            For now, however, having carefully considered our users their goals, we believe that our redesigned 
            shuttle app has the potential to reverse the frustration associated with boarding a shuttle into 
            a swift, painless, and even enjoyable experience. 
            <br><br>
            Most excitingly, we reached out to the Harvard shuttle system following the completion of our prototype,
            and are now in talks with their team to implement some of our changes. An improved shuttle app is especially 
            relevant now given that the engineering school is moving across the river to Allston next semester, 
            meaning that many students will now be much more shuttle reliant. Real-world impact!
