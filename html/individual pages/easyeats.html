        <div class="text">

            This past week in EngSci-22: Designing for Desirability, we were assigned a 1-week-long design 
            challenge in which we were asked to a) conceptualize a product that targeted and modified a specific behavior 
            using Cialdini’s and/or Fogg’s theories on human behavior and b) to create a user experience 
            journey map as our deliverable. 
            <br><br>
            My group envisioned an app that targeted decision fatigue associated with finding and picking 
            restaurants by gamifying the experience through a Tinder-esque swipe UI that was easily filterable and 
            reduced the often text-heavy interfaces of restaurant apps to a majority visual interface.
            <br><br>
            While my group decided to focus on an experience targeted towards the individual, as I was at office hours working through 
            product details with my TF (big, big, shoutout to Rosa Weinberg for her time and advice), we came up 
            with a branching idea that was so much fun that I needed to write it down as a formal proposal. 
            That said, here it is below!
        </div>

        <div class="row" style="margin-bottom: 3vh">
            <div class="col-md-4 left">
                <div class="subtitle">PROBLEM STATEMENT</div>

            <div class="col-md-8 right">
                My target behavioral problem is more specifically as follows: <b>the indecision in deciding where to eat that occurs 
                    in group settings.</b>
            </div>
        </div>

            <div class="dropdown">
                <button type="button" class="collapsible dropdown-toggle">What are the 3 reasons behind this indecision?</button>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>In order to help groups make eating decisions more efficiently, I first needed to understand why this 
                        indecision occured. So why is choosing a restaurant so difficult for groups? I boiled it down to three 
                        major categories:
                        <ul class="bullets-ee">
                            <li><b>1/</b>  Taking responsibility for your own happiness is one thing, but being responsible for others’ 
                                happiness is an entirely separate problem. Scary.
                                <!-- <div class="sub-bullets">
                                    - Food is a highly personal preference and, to make it even more complicated, it can vary 
                                    day to day or even hour to hour for any given individual. It’s extremely difficult to 
                                    predict or understand someone else’s preferences, so why would you want to risk choosing
                                    a meal that another person dislikes?
                                    <br><br>- Also, inside you know that you have your personal preferences, but you don’t 
                                    want to be the person that imposes your preferences on others and then becomes responsible
                                    for the entire group's happiness. 
                                </div> -->
                            </li>
                            <li><b>2/</b>  There are So. Many. Choices. This indecision-increasing factor applies to both individuals and groups. 
                                There are really just so many options for food, and while we would generally agree that optionality a 
                                privilege, humans don’t always seem to do too well with it. 
                            </li>
                            <li><b>3/</b>  Am I going to spend my time and energy Yelping, or are you? Yelp is wonderful and I use it 
                                all the time, but it is also a dense and energy-draining website. People are lazy (or maybe 
                                just tired?), and everyone wants to delegate the research to someone else.
                            </li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="col-md-4 left">
                <div class="subtitle">SOLUTION</div><br>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-8 right">
                To resolve this indecision, Ciao Chow! aims to do the following:
                <ul class="bullets-ee">
                    <li><b>1/</b>  It incorporates all members in the decision-making process, and therefore divides up the 
                        responsibility between the group so that the pressure is reduced for every individual.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>2/</b>  It gives the group a limited number of choices, because in the end having 10,000 options 
                        on Yelp v. having 20 options on this app is not really going to affect anyone's meal utility [in terms 
                        of satisfaction gained]. As the age-old adage goes, “You can’t miss what you 
                        never had."
                    </li>
                    <li><b>3/</b>  It makes the entire process less energy-draining by employing a gamified, visual interface 
                        that encourages users to make quick choices based on visceral reactions. As the other age-old 
                        adage goes, “A picture is worth 1000 words.”
                    </li>
                    </ul>
            </div>
        </div>
            
        <div class="text">
            So how does this app achieve the goals above? I maintained the swipe interface that my team 
            used for our restaurant app in the design challenge, but modified it so that all members of a dinner 
            party can enter into a group. The app then presents a set of filters, which breaks down the decision making process  
            through straightforward questions that are easy to answer. 
            Afterwards, each member is individually shown a set of restaurant cards on their app, which 
            they swipe through on their own time (it should only take a few minutes maximum for an individual). When 
            all members of the group finish swiping, the group is shown the cards that all members have swiped right on 
            or “liked.” In this manner, the app cuts the number of restaurant options down significantly
            and guarantees that the final selection is one maximizes that satisfaction of all group 
            members. 
            <br><br>
            For a better idea of the breakdown of the process, I’ve attached a user journey map below. That 
            being said, the product may not be entirely clear without the full prototype, which is to come soon!

        <div class="subtitle">Conclusion</div>
        Through careful consideration of our users and their needs, we redesigned the existing shuttle 
        tracker into an experience that is both easy and pleasurable to use. iShuttle engages users through 
        its clean, efficient, and accurate interface and provides a number of additional features that 
        transform the tracker into a tool fit for frequent, recurring use.
        <br><br>
        Of course, no product is ever free from the possibility (or perhaps inevitable fate?) of further 
        improvement. We have a number of small details to figure out, as well as other additional 
        features we'd like to see included. For one, we think that the communication between the users and
        the app should absolutely be a two way street - in other words, we'd like the students to be able to 
        give immediate and frequent feedback to the shuttle system to allow for constant improvement. We 
        considered having a pop-up notification that would have the user thumbs up or down the shuttle depending
        on its timeliness, but are still navigating the balance between enough notifications to be helpful
        and too many notifications which can become burdensome.
